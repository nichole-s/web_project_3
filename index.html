              some unknown regions of your country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting 
              in New England where it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total 
              of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous 
              rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous 
              author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.</p>

          <p class="card__text">Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is 
                    an extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich 
                    history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main 
                    state you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is 
                    going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for 
                    an arduous trek.</p>
          <p class="card__text">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European 
                    settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to 
                    L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy 
                    backpack from for your 3-month expedition. </p>

          <p class="card__text">There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in 
            springtime New Hampshire. As serene and beautiful as it 
            was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled 
            than its neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
          <p class="card__text">You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it 
            make sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately 
            for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the 
            world proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland 
            headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof 
            boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather 
            you may be confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. 
            These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.</p>

          <p class="card__text">Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also 
            has several other reasons for going down in history. 
            Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights 
            and Hauls the World,” has been home to the world-famous 
            General Electric Company.</p>
          <p class="card__text">This is where modern power generators were born as well as 
            contemporary means of transmitting energy. So we figured this 
            would be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light 
            for your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads 
            on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.</p>

          <p class="card__text">Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word 
            “eerie,” although it can be from time to time, is another town 
            worth passing through for several different reasons. While it 
            might be most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg 
            address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania 
            also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)</p>
          <p class="card__text">The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't 
            already guessed, can be summed up by using one delicious word: 
            chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, 
            one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this 
            tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National 
            Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!</p>
          <p class="card__text">The current cost of a Hershey's Chocolate bar: about 60¢.</p>

          <p class="card__text">From the college capital of Columbus to the clean 
            coastline of Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. 
            Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular 
            region of North America, over 200 of which have 
            registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 
            1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing 
            shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's 
            largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to 
            ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably 
            be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete 
            (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break 
            to ride as many roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!</p>
          <p class="card__text">The cost of a daily ticket: about $100.</p>
